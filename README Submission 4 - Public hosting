My app is hosted within glitch. The reason for this is because it is very simple and quilessck to set up aswell as being free to use. One problem i had to overcome when using clitch was the env secrets kept disappearing due to the connection disappearing constanlty. After allowing time and starting up a new tab the issue resolved itself.

My Plan: 
1. Make the lesson plan display the infomation from the database
2. Intergrate the random room generator with web sockets to create a one on one chat 
3. Attempt to intergrate the google api again, (implimented but commented out)
4. Style the website with bootstrap
5. User testing to make the user experience perfeect
